GitHub and GitLab are supported.  However, only one Git type is supported in a setup.  Git type is determined by the GitOps Reposiotry URL used during bootstrapping/initialization.  For example, if GitHub repostory URL is specificed during bootstraping, all service/application Git repsostiories must be GitHub repositories.
